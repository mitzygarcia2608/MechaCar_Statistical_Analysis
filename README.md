•	The two Variables that are the most likely to provide a non random amount of variance are vehicle length and ground clearance . 

•	The null hypotheses is that the slope is zero,The P-value isl5.35e-11.  Since this number is less than the standard significance lever of 0.5 mean that there is sufficient evidence to say that the null hypotheses is not true.

•	The R-squared value of 0.7149 means that the model will be correct 72% percent of the time.

•	From the summary table we can conclude that the “Var_psi” is 62.29 meaning that the current design meets the necessary specifications.
